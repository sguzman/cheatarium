# Cheatarium

**A wonderland of console cheats.**

Cheatarium collects, preserves, organizes, and explains video game cheats: Game Genie and Action Replay codes, GameShark and other device codes, emulator cheats, button sequences, passwords, unlockables, and strange ways to bend a game to your will.

This is primarily a **console and handheld game** archive. The goal is a fun, searchable collection that respects the original community work and remains useful decades later.

## Explore

- [Curated games](curated/) — human-friendly cheats grouped by platform and game, including versions and code formats.
- [Original archives](archive/) — unmodified, attributable imports in their original formats.
- [Platforms](platforms/platforms.json) — stable platform identifiers, including console and handheld generations.
- [Sources](sources/README.md) — upstream repositories, attribution, licenses, and snapshots.
- [Adding cheats](docs/ADDING-CHEATS.md) — how new collections and individual cheats enter the archive.
- [Design](docs/DESIGN.md) — the boundaries and data model.
- [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) — systems, imports, and future features.

## Principles

1. **Preserve originals.** Keep imported files intact; make curated versions separately.
2. **Provenance is part of the cheat.** Every imported file must link back to an upstream source, pinned revision, and licensing information.
3. **A code is not universal.** Distinguish console, game, region, revision, emulator/device, and code format.
4. **Don't mistake collected for verified.** Imported cheats are untested until actually checked.
5. **Make room for the weird stuff.** Traditional cheat devices, secrets, glitches, passwords, and quality-of-life modifications belong here.
6. **No game images or firmware.** This is a cheat library, not a ROM or BIOS archive.

## Status

The foundation is live. **Eight complete Libretro console/handheld collections** have been imported: 14,713 native `.cht` source files, pinned to the 2026-10-05 upstream revision with byte-level provenance. The platform registry covers 50 systems; three games have starter curated records. This distinction matters: archiving thousands of native files is not the same as curating and verifying every individual code. Other systems, better indexing, search, and integrations will follow without rewriting the archive.

The archive is separate from any particular emulator, but future integrations may make these cheats directly usable in projects such as Starbyte.
